This project is in the very early stages and I would consider myself more of a program hacker
than a pure programmer. This is a project that I wrote for people to use where I work (about
500 people). I know that for the general public there are currently a lot of shortfalls with 
the program. I would love to find people interested in making this program more versitile and 
robust while helping me code it in a more efficient manner. The database could be done better 
also, but you know what they say. "You have to start somewhere". 

I do feel that this program would be very useful to small businesses to track vaction requests
and that is why I am submitting it. Even if there ends up being a complete rewrite I think it
is a great program idea.

In the future I would like to give the ability to export data to other Human Resource programs
so the data does not have to be entered manually.

PROGRAM INSTALLATION
--------------------


1. Create a database for the vacation.sql file and import the file.  

2. Edit the /includes/db_info.inc.php file to allow access to your new database

3. Edit the /includes/config.inc.php file. This file displays information in the footer of each page

4. You can create a company logo to be added to the top left of each page. The image should be no larger
   than 165 x 70. If you create a larger image you must change settings in /css/site.css and /includes/menu.inc.php.

5. Open the vacation program in a browser and login as 
		user: admin 
		password: admin
	Admin is limited to site configuration and adding employees. Once you add yourself to the system you should become the
	site administrator. Each supervisor must setup their departments default configuration.		
		
6. Browse the menus to Administration > Site setup
	
	A. Select "Add/edit employee categories" and create employee categories like FT = Full Time

	B. Select "Add/edit company departments" and create your company departments

	C. Select Add/edit time off types" and create timeoff types like "Vacation Paid", "Vacation Unpaid",
	   "Personal Day" etc...
  	D. Select "Add/edit fiscal year information". This controls the year that all vaction requests are associated with
  	   for calculating time left for the year.

  	E. Select "Add holidays and notable dates". You can add any holidays or important company dates that will be displayed 
  	   on the calendar. 

  	F. Select "Add a new employee". You must add new employees and associate them with a department.
		-- Add yourself first and become a site administrator then log in with your username and password

  	G. Select "Add/update earned time off". After employees are entered you must add their earned time off before 
  	   they can request time off

7. Log out and login with your new user ID.

8. Before you can view the vacation calendar you must configure your department - 
	On the menu go to Administration > Configure vacation restrictions for your department
	 A. Fill in all fields.

9. More notes will be added over time. This is just a start.
